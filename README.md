# GravitationalWaveResearch

A collection of programs implementing the numerical model I built of a component of the electromagnetic four-potential in the presence of a gravitational wave. The results could be more simply interpreted as the electric field in oscillating spacetime.

The WaveEquation and PhotonGravityWave files produce a 2D animation as their output.
The final product is PhotonGravityWave(2+1)-D.py, and PhotonGravityWavePerpendicularCase(2+1)-D.py is the special case of our plane of interest being orthogonal with the incoming gravitational wave. I have included it as it runs with a much faster runtime.

These programs can be easily extended to 3 spatial dimension, but, due to the reasons outlined in the documentation, I think 2+1 dimensional output is the most appropriate choice.

All work was done at the University of Zurich.
